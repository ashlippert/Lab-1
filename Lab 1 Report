# Lab 1:   Knowing your instruments
# Authors: Ashlyn Lippert and Seth Daniel
# Date:    February 2nd, 2025

# Introduction:
  This lab introduces basic electronic test equipment, including a Digital Multimeter (DMM), an oscilloscope (O-scope), a Function Generator (F.G.), and a Direct Current Power Supply (DCPS). The goal of this lab is to learn how to use these tools to generate and measure common electronic signals, and learn how to use GitHub for submitting lab reports.
  During the lab, different electronic signals were created and measured using the equipment to understand how each tool works, practice obtaining accurate measurements, and obtain hands-on practice. Additionally, experience was gained in GitHub which will prepare the group for lab report writing and submission.
